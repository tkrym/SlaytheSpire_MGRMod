      "The slots above you are the #yNote #ySlots , you can generate #yNotes there. NL #yNotes are resources with certain effects, they are triggered whenever slots are #yfull and do something. NL The action that #yNotes are triggered is called #yChord, it will trigger some powers and increase the #yCounter by #b1 . NL When the #yCounter reaches its maximum, enter #yAwaken , A special #yStance .",
      "The most direct means of getting #yNotes is to play cards. NL Whenever you play a card, generate a #yBasic #yNote that corresponds to it. The types and effects are as below: NL #yAttack Card: #yAttackNote , Deal damage to a random enemy. NL #ySkill Card: #yDefendNote , Gain block. NL #yPower Card: #yDrawNote , Draw cards. NL #yStatus Card: #yDebuffNote , Apply #yWeak and #yVulnerable to all enemies. NL #yCurse Card: #yArtifactNote , Gain #yArtifact. NL There are also other types of notes that you will encounter later. NL Well, it's actually quite simple, just give it a try. :)"
